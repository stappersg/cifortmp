How to create a distribution :
   Always start with
   make clean

AN OFFICIAL RELEASE IS GENERATED BY PASSING A VERSION MACRO
WITH A DECIMAL POINT TO  make.

Other VERSION or no VERSION means it is a beta.

   Release generic version, official
   make zip VERSION=4.0
   Result in ciforth-4.0.tar.gz

   Release generic version, beta
   make zip VERSION=3d286
   Result in ciforth-3d286.tar.gz (not yet)
   Or use $V.

   Release Linux version, official (same for LINA64ZIP)
   make clean
   make LINA32ZIP VERSION=4.0
   Result in lina-4.0.tar.gz

   Release Linux version, snapshot date version
   make clean
   make VERSION # Based on date
   make LINA32ZIP
   Result in lina-2004mar18.tar.gz

   Release Linux version, beta
   make clean
   make LINA32ZIP VERSION=3d286
   Result in lina-2d286.tar.gz
   Or use $V from setenv equal to latest rcs name of ci86.gnr

   Release mina / wina
   Use
   releasemina.bat 4d0
   releasemina.bat 3d275
   releasewina.bat 4d0
   releasewina.bat 3d275

How to patch, say release 4.0.2

Make sure there is a branch rel-4-0-patches
Get it. Because you want to make 4.0.2
apparently you will get 4.0.2 plus maybe some patches
already made.
Before release, call this version 4.0.3.
From then on 4.0.2 can no longer be patched.

How to move a sticky tag to a new branch:
In this example from 4.15.2.5 to 4.15.3.1

Just use rcs to do this:
ln -s $CVSROOT/ciforth RCS
NEWBRANCH=4.15.0.3
co -l -rrel-4-0-patches $f
cvs diff $f     # check : no diffs
ci -f -r$NEWBRANCH $f
rcs -Nrel-4-0-patches $f
rcs -Nrel-4-0-patches:$NEWBRANCH $f
rm RCS
cvs diff $f     # check : no diffs

Howto install an info file :
This inserts a finder for lina into the topmost hierarchy of info.

cp lina.info /usr/share/info
install-info --entry='* lina :: a simple Linux native Forth implementation' \
             lina.info /usr/share/info/dir

How to make a 64 bit release.
rm VERSION
make lina64.zip VERSION=beta-5-63
Now the executable has to be build on a 64 bit system, because the
executable generated on Suse 32 bit, doesn't run.
as -64 lina64.s
ld -s -N a.out -o lina64

How to make a 64 bit wina.
make ci86.wina64.fas
fasm ci86.wina64.fas -M300000

2012 sep 2
A 64 bit release can be made on a 32 bit system if fasm is used.
make ci86.lina64.fas
fasm ci86.lina64.fas
mv ci86.lina64 ci86.lina64

2012 sep 20
The 64 version is now made using fasm, so
make lina64
uses fasm
`` make glina64 '' uses gas and works only on a 64 bit system.
